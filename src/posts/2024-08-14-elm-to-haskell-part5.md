Hello everyone! In my [last post](https://flaviocorpa.com/haskell-for-elm-developers-giving-names-to-stuff-part-4-parser-combinators.html), instead of going for the low-hanging fruit (like I'm doing right now 🤣) I decided to talk about parser combinators because it is a topic that I _really_ enjoy. But now we should proceed on the quest of "giving names to stuff", so let us talk about Semigroups and Monoids!

## What is a Semigroup?

As you may already know, these fancy terms come from [**algebra**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup), but we are not going to write a mathematical post, we are just going to focus on learning Haskell through simple Elm code examples. So, how are Semigroups defined in Haskell?

```haskell
class Semigroup a where
  (<>) :: a -> a -> a
```

Actually it is not something really exciting, a `Semigroup` is every single type that has a `<>` operator (or an `append` function, which behaves the same way) and just allows us to put things together... 

The only interesting prerequisite that we need to have in mind to be considered a Semigroup, is that the `<>` operation should be **associative**: `a <> (b <> c) = (a <> b) <> c`.

For Elm, what simple examples come to mind? Of course, lists and strings!

```elm
> [1, 2] ++ [3, 4]
[1,2,3,4] : List number
> "dear" ++ " " ++ "semigroups!"
"dear semigroups!" : String
```

If you notice, the `++` operator is just sugar for this operation (which we will call `mappend` from now on) on lists and strings, we are just concatenating stuff together!

In fact, a quick search in [`elm/core`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Array#append) looking up the `append` function reveals us some Semigroups that we have available in Elm, namely: `Array`, `String` and `List`.

But is this all there is to it? 🤔

## Enter the Monoid!

Monoids in Haskell are defined as this:

```haskell
class Semigroup a => Monoid a where
  mappend :: a -> a -> a
  mappend = (<>)

  mempty :: a

  mconcat :: [a] -> a
  mconcat = foldr mappend mempty
```

One of the first things we can notice, is that every Monoid **has** to have a Semigroup instance, and this is logical because we still want to put things together. In fact, in the following line we already see what we agreed on above, that the funny looking `<>` is gonna be known as `mappend` (if you are wondering, the "m" before append stands for Monoid, of course!).

But what makes Monoids special is the next following bit: `mempty :: a`. Yes, every Monoid NEEDs to have an `identity`, an element you can `mappend` to the rest of the elements without changing its intrisic value (this is sometimes also known as the `empty` case).

Can you think about what this `mempty` element is for Strings and Lists? 🤔

Of course, the empty list and empty string, respectively!

```elm
> [1, 2, 3] ++ []
[1,2,3] : List number
> "immutable" ++ ""
"immutable" : String
```

Notice now the third thing we can see in the definition of Monoids: `mconcat :: [a] -> a`, this one already has a default value (so we don't have to provide it, it comes for free by defining `mempty` and `mappend`): `foldr mappend mempty`, we will talk more about this in the last section of the blogpost.

For now, let us focus for a moment in this `mconcat` function:

```haskell
mconcat :: Monoid m => [m] -> m
```

From our current intuition about this concept, it should be clear to us that, if we have a list of things that we can join (or `mappend`), we should be able to get out a single thing out with all the things in that `List` appended, right? (This sounds way too obvious but please bear with me).

Then, let's search the [`elm/core`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/1.0.5/String#concat) package again for instances of this `concat` operation:

```elm
concat : List (List a) -> List a

concat [[1,2],[3],[4,5]] -- -> [1,2,3,4,5]

concat : List String -> String

concat ["never","the","less"] -- -> "nevertheless"
```

Our usual suspects, `List` and `String`... but what happens when we look up `empty`? 🤔

```elm
empty : Array a
empty : Dict k v
empty : Set a
```

`Array`, `Dict` and `Set` also pop up! The trick here is, for `Dict` and `Set` the `mappend` operation is actually called [`Dict.union`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/1.0.5/Dict#union) and [`Set.union`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/1.0.5/Set#union) respectively!

```elm
union : Dict comparable v -> Dict comparable v -> Dict comparable v
union : Set comparable -> Set comparable -> Set comparable
```

In fact, there are some [Monoid packages](https://github.com/arowM/elm-monoid/blob/1.1.0/src/Monoid.elm) in Elm that reveal us some **really** interesting stuff:

```elm
batch : List (Cmd msg) -> Cmd msg
batch : List (Sub msg) -> Sub msg
```

Does this remind you of something? Let me refresh your memory:

```haskell
mconcat :: Monoid m => [m] -> m
```

YES! Some everyday used Monoids in Elm include: `Array`, `List`, `String`, `Dict`, `Set`, `Cmd` and `Sub`... therefore, as always... YOU HAVE BEEN USING MONOIDS ALL ALONG™️!!! 🤯🤯🤯 (Ok this is already part of the trademark by now 🤣).

## Monoids for `number` 👨🏼‍🔬

If you have a bit of a curious mind, you might notice the following functions in Elm:

```elm
> (+)
<function> : number -> number -> number
> (*)
<function> : number -> number -> number
```

If you remember from [our very first post](https://flaviocorpa.com/haskell-for-elm-developers-giving-names-to-stuff-part-1-functors.html), `number` is a typeclass defined for us in Elm with which we can do very little.

Anyway, by looking at the shape of the addition and multiplication operator, we may realise they both match the `mappend` type signature! This means that for a certain type, **maybe more than one Monoid instance is possible**. This is very relevant, as the `mempty` for this two Monoids (they are called `Sum` and `Product` in Haskell) are different:

```elm
> 1 + 2 + 0
3 : number
> 3 * 3 * 1
9 : number
```

Yes, the identity value (the one that does not affect the result) for summation is `0`, whereas for multiplication is `1`! Math is really interesting, isn't it!? 🤓

## The Secret Behind EVERY Fold

But after all this is said and done... why should I bother? Is this just some nerdy terminology??

Well, now comes what was for me one of the most mind-boggling programming moments: have you ever had to reduce (or `fold`) anything in programming? If so, brace yourself for impact because...

> **Behind every folding operation, lies hidden a Monoid instance**!!!

🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯

Let me give you some time to digest that... remember how earlier we said that we were going to talk a bit more about the fact that `mconcat` is defined as `mconcat = foldr mappend mempty`?

I will casually remind you of how `foldr` is defined in Elm (this also applies to Haskell, of course!):

```elm
foldr : (a -> b -> b) -> b -> List a -> b
```

This means that, every time you are folding **anything**, you need a "reducing" function and and accumulator. The accumulator, if you are following my train of thought, is the `mempty` value every Monoid has to have. And the "reducing" function (in the case of `foldr` is `(a -> b -> b)`), is just a function from `a -> b` that is also able to concat two `b`s! (This means that in reality this "reducing" function is effectively like calling `fmap` and then `mconcat`).

So, whether you like it or not, every single time in your life that you had to `reduce` or `fold` anything in programming, you were using an underlying Monoid all along! ✨🎩🪄

## A brief word about `foldMap`

In fact, the relationship between folds and Monoids makes itself super evident in the [`foldMap`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.20.0.1/docs/Prelude.html#v:foldMap) function that we have available in Haskell (sadly, this is not so common in Elm 😢):

```haskell
foldMap :: Monoid m => (a -> m) -> [a] -> m
```

Since `foldMap` requires a Monoid instance, this is like folding but in _autopilot_ for us, because the appending function is taken directly from the Monoid instance!

```haskell
>>> foldMap Sum [1, 3, 5]
Sum {getSum = 9}

>>> foldMap Product [1, 3, 5]
Product {getProduct = 15}

>>> foldMap (replicate 3) [1, 2, 3]
[1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]
```

This is really convenient and can spare you from using `foldr` or `foldl` if you know which is the explicit Monoid from which you want to fold on! 🙌🏻
