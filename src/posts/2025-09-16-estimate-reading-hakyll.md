A while ago, I decided it was time to start blogging again, and I used [Robert Pearce](https://robertwpearce.com/)'s excellent [hakyll-nix-template](https://robertwpearce.com/the-hakyll-nix-template-tutorial.html) to bootstrap this blog and as a way to learn [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) and Nix a little bit better. If it is your personal blog after all, you can use whatever you want, right? üòâ

If you also use Hakyll, you might have wondered how can we calculate the estimated reading time for each post in a simple way, so here is the Haskell code:

```haskell
readingTimeField :: String -> Context String
readingTimeField key =
  field key calculate
 where
  calculate :: Item String -> Compiler String
  calculate item = do
    let body = itemBody item
    pure $ withTagList acc body
  acc ts = [TagText $ show $ time ts]
  -- M. Brysbaert, Journal of Memory and Language (2009) vol 109. DOI: 10.1016/j.jml.2019.104047
  time ts = foldr count 0 ts `div` 238
  count (TagText s) n = n + length (words s)
  count _ n = n
```

What's funny about the above implementation is that I found an actual research [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749596X19300786) that tells us the average reading speed for adults and non-fiction, so I did not have to guess it!

> This is the actual code I'm using in my blog, you can have a look at the whole code base [here](https://github.com/kutyel/kutyel-hakyll), its Open Source! üïäÔ∏è

After creating the `readingTimeField` function, you can use it in your `postCtx` like this:

```haskell
postCtx :: Context String
postCtx =
  constField "root" mySiteRoot
    <> constField "siteName" mySiteName
    <> dateField "date" "%d/%m/%Y"
    <> readingTimeField "readingtime" -- this is the new addition
    <> defaultContext
```

And finally, you can use it in your templates like this:

```html
<div class="info">
  <small class="italic">$date$</small>
  <small class="italic"> | $readingtime$ min read</small>
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

It is as simple as it gets, the end result looks like this:
