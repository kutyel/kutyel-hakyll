`elm-ui` is a package for layout and interface design. This is a novel iteration on declarative styling where you can use Elm types and functions to define your UI in a declarative way.

The novel part is that it **does not require you to know CSS** to be used. The API is very simple and can be learned quickly! 💅🏻

The approach taken by `elm-ui` is based on two big ideas: Getting the compiler to verify as much of the layout and styling as possible by defining them in Elm code Enabling refactoring capabilities of Elm for UI code.

## Future new egghead.io Elm course!?

If you would like me to work on a [free community egghead.io resource](https://egghead.io/q?access_state=free) to learn Elm from scratch, you can please [sponsor my work on Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kutyel/) or just reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FlavioCorpa) and let me know!

The more requests I get the more motivation I will have to put in the time and effort to create the next ultimate Elm learning resource! 🙌🏻
